# Notes on NDVI 

Several attributes derived from NDVI have been used as surrogated of ecological processes (see [*Pettorelli et al. 2015*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2005.05.011)). Here you can see a summary:

## Growing-season length (GSL)

* The GSL exerts a strong control on ecosystem function (see [Linderholm 2006](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2006.03.006))

* Three main techniques to determine growing season change: 
 * Phenology
 * NDVI 
 * Surface air temperatures
 
## Resources (TODO)

* Three decades of multi-dimensional change in global leaf phenology [url](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n4/full/nclimate2533.html)
